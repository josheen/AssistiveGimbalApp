# AssistiveGimbalApp
Stabilization techniques and tools for  cameras are frequently sought by videographers looking to obtain fluid footage when in motion. 
The development and design of a three-axis electronic phone gimbal is explored in this paper as per the request of the University of Alberta Student 
Photography Club (UASPC). Specific requirements for the gimbal outlined by the UASPC include a method to turn on and off the gimbal, implementation of 
a control system for each axis, a method to manually set a focus point, availability of cinematic modes that execute preset movements, a method to 
discern battery percentage  and implementation of safety redundant systems.

Alongside the Gimbal, we decided to make an assistive App to extend the possible interactions that users could have with the Gimbal.
We created an iOS App through Swift to enable users to handle things such as taking and saving pictures, detecting objects, and tracking objects.
